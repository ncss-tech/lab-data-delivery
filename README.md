# lab-data-delivery
Re-working the LDM + NASIS data integration process for snapshot and future web-service based delivery.

## Snapshot Delivery

### Static Products

   * SQLite databases: morphologic and lab data
   * ESRI FileGeodatabases: morphologic and lab data
   * Access database (?) for those who still depend on this format
   * use-specific databases (SQLite): 
      + soil color ranges
      + simplified soil morphology: structure, fragments, color, redox, etc.
      + field-measured properties such as Ksat
      



### Web-Services
   * SDA-like interface to tables included in the file-based snapshots
