"lab_analysis_procedure","The Analysis Procedure table is a lookup table which contains information about the analysiscprocedure.  The analysis procedure is the basic analytical method applied to a prepared sample.  This procedure may be applied to different sample preparations, but the default size-fraction is the most commonly used size-fraction.  An analysis may have more than one procedure, one of which is chosen by the analyst to complete the analysis."
"lab_analyte","The Analyte table is a lookup table which contains information about an analyte (primary result of an analysis by a procedure).  The LIMS uses this data to format the data, provide abbreviations and units of measure for reporting the data."
"lab_area","A lookup table containing the list of valid NRCS areas, both current and obsolete for Country, County, Soil Survey Area and MLRA.  Note that a soil survey area code is a concatenation of a U.S. state FIPS code and a soil survey area number.  Since this table is intended to record only U.S. and U.S. territory soil survey areas, every soil survey area code in this table should be unique."
"lab_calculations_including_estimates_and_default_values","This table contains the results of calculations using measured, estimated and default values."
"lab_chemical_properties","This table contains the results of the analysis of chemical properties of the soil that are measured by the KSSL and cooperating university laboratories."
"lab_combine_nasis_ncss","This table is a linkage betwwen NASIS Pedon morphological and the Lab data. This table stores information about locations, layers or horizons of a pedon that has had samples submitted to the SSL at the National Soil Survey Center or one of the various laboratories at NCSS cooperating universities.  Data is periodically transferred from the SSL database to this table."
"lab_layer","The Layer table contains information about the layer, including the field identifier, horizon designation, reporting, and depths.  Layer in the LIMS can be a true soil horizon or a reporting layer which does not correspond to the traditional soil horizon.  The lay_rpt_seq_num sets the order of display for layer reports.  The layer is the intended way analytical results are reported in the LIMS.  New to the LIMS is the ability to allow stratified or vertically subdivided layers to be reported."
"lab_major_and_trace_elements_and_oxides","This table contains major and trace elements, total oxides, x-ray data and the method codes related to the methods used."
"lab_method_code","This table relates a non-connotative method code with the preparation, instrument, size fraction, analyte, procedure (if any) and calculation algorithm (if any) represented by that method code."
"lab_mineralogy_glass_count","The Optical Mineralogy glass count Count Data table holds the raw data for the sample.  The table hold what type of optical count, the size fraction and replicate number."
"lab_mir","Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It is based on the principle that molecular vibrations and electronic transitions associated with soil constituents absorb light while interacting with radiation."
"lab_mir_wavelength","The lab_mir_wavelength table is a lookup of the collection of wavelengths used for sampling the samples"
"lab_pedon","The LIMS Pedon table holds general information about the pedon.  The pedon is associated with a site.  The converse is not necessarily true."
"lab_physical_properties","This table contains the results of analysis of physical properties of the soil that are measured by the KSSL and cooperating university laboratories."
"lab_preparation","The Preparation table holds the information about the type of preparation, size of the orginal and final fractions prepared,  default container type and preparation sort order."
"lab_rosetta_key","ROSETTA, which implements five hierarchical pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for the estimation of water retention, and the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity."
"lab_site","The LIMS Site table holds the site (location) information about the place where the samples or pedon originated."
"lab_webmap","This table is used to develop a webmap which is used to interactive display of geographic information pertaining to laboratory information.  The interactive map offers a national database of soil characterization data, allowing location of pedons spatially. Pedons are the smallest unit of soil containing all the soil horizons of a particular soil type. Clicking on a pedon location within the interactive map will enable users to access lab data about that pedon. View the new interactive map by clicking here offsite link image. You can also view the map on the Soil Lab Data Mart website (bottom left of page) here: https://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/."
"lab_xray_and_thermal","The X-ray Diffraction Data table holds the raw data for the each mineral in the sample."
